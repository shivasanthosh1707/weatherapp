#Overview

The Weather Forecast App is a web application that allows users to check the weather conditions for a specific city. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive user interface and fetches weather data from a weather API to provide real-time information.

Features:

#Input field to enter the city name #Search button to fetch weather data #Display of location, temperature, and weather description #Responsive design for various screen sizes

How it Works:

#Input City: Users can enter the name of the city they want to check the weather for in the input field provided. #Search: Upon clicking the "Search" button, the app fetches weather data for the entered city from a weather API. #Display: The app displays the location (city), current temperature, and weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny) on the screen.

Technical Details:

#HTML: Defines the structure of the app, including input fields, buttons, and weather information display. #CSS: Styles the app layout, colors, fonts, and background image. #JavaScript: Handles user interaction, fetches weather data from the API, and updates the UI dynamically with the retrieved information. #Weather API: The app utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's input city.

Future Enhancements:

#Additional Weather Data: Include additional weather information such as humidity, wind speed, and forecast for multiple days. 3User Location Detection: Implement geolocation to automatically detect the user's location and fetch weather data accordingly. #User Preferences: Allow users to customize the app interface, such as choosing between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units. #Error Handling: Improve error handling for cases where the entered city is not found or the API request fails.
